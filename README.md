# NTU Swimming Pool Website 🏊‍♂️⚡

A comprehensive platform designed for Nanyang Technological University (NTU) students and staff to track real-time swimming pool status and connect with the community.

## 📖 Overview

This project aims to solve the uncertainty of pool availability due to weather or maintenance. It combines official meteorological data with crowdsourced reports to provide the most accurate status updates. Additionally, it features a social hub for swimmers to interact, find swimming buddies, or report lost items.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🌦️ Real-Time Pool Status (Dual-Validation System)
We use a **Cross-Validation Mechanism** to ensure accuracy:
* **Source A (Official):** Automatically fetches real-time lightning alert data via the **NEA (National Environment Agency) API**.
* **Source B (Crowdsourced):** Allows users currently at the pool to report the actual open/closed status (Live Reporting).
> The system combines these two inputs to determine whether the pool is safe and open.

### 2. 💬 Social Community & Plaza
A dedicated space for the NTU swimming community:
* **Interaction:** Users can create posts, write comments, and like interesting content.
* **Connections:** Find friends, swimming partners, or organize meetups.
* **Lost & Found:** A specific tag/area to post about items lost or found at the pool.
* **Profile Customization:** Users can upload unique avatars and update their nicknames.
