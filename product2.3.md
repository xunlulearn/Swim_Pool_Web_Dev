# 2.3 Identity & Access Management (IAM)

* **Access Control**: Open registration for any valid email address.
* **Verification Method**: SMTP Email verification. User receives a **6-digit verification code** (OTP). User must enter this code on the website to verify their account. The account is not active until verified. No password-only accounts allowed.
    > [!WARNING]
    > **Critical**: Do NOT use NTU email addresses (e.g., `@e.ntu.edu.sg`) for registration. The university's spam filter blocks these automated verification emails. Users must use personal email (Gmail, Outlook, etc.).
